Description: A dynamic programming algorithm for optimal univariate k-means
 clustering. Minimizing the sum of squares of within-cluster distances, the
 algorithm guarantees optimality and reproducibility. Its advantage over
 heuristic k-means algorithms in efficiency and accuracy is increasingly
 pronounced as the number of clusters k increases. It provides an alternative
 to heuristic k-means algorithms for univariate clustering.
